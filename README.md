*Project Description*
This project is a microservice-based web application that provides [specific functionality, e.g., a user authentication system, an e-commerce platform, etc.]. It is fully containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed in any environment supporting Docker. The project is designed with DevOps best practices in mind, utilizing Docker, Docker Compose, and CI/CD automation.

*Features*
User authentication (login and registration)
Persistent database storage using Docker volumes
Custom Docker networks for service communication
Automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and delivery
Health checks for service monitoring

*Technologies Used*
Backend: Node.js, Express (or Python, Flask, etc.)
Database: MongoDB (or MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
Frontend: React, HTML/CSS
Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (or Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.)

*Prerequisites*
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
Git
Docker
Docker Compose
Node.js (if you're running locally without Docker)

*Installation and Setup*
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/enochblake/yolo
cd your-project

2. Running the Application with Docker
Build and run the containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will build and run the services, including the backend, frontend, and database containers.

3. Accessing the Application
Once the containers are running, access the application at:
http://localhost:3000  //for frontend
http://localhost:5000  //for backend

*Docker and Containerization*
1. Docker Compose Setup
This project uses Docker Compose to manage multi-container orchestration. The docker-compose.yml file defines the services, networks, and volumes.

Backend Service: Runs the Node.js backend with custom networking and environment variables.
Database Service: Runs MongoDB (or other database) in a separate container, with persistent volumes for data storage.
2. Persistent Volumes
The database container uses a Docker volume to ensure persistent data storage even when containers are stopped or restarted.

3. Custom Networks
All services communicate via a custom Docker network to ensure secure and isolated communication between containers.

*CI/CD Pipeline*
This project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the following:

Build and test the application
Build Docker images
Push Docker images to DockerHub with semantic versioning
Deploy to production (if applicable)
CI/CD Workflow File
You can find the CI/CD workflow file under .github/workflows/ci.yml.

*Usage*
Once the application is running, you can use the following endpoints for testing:

Login: POST /api/auth/login
Register: POST /api/auth/register
Add Product: POST /api/products (if applicable)
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
